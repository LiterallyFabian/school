    <h1 >B-25 Mitchell medium bomber</h1>

        <div class="brodtext">


        <p>
            The B-25 Was a medium bomber that served in the American airforce during the second world war.
            The B-25 mainly served in the pacific war between the US and Japan.
            It was first made famous during the Doolittle raid were 16 B-25 bombers led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle successfully attacked mainland Japan.
            It was a much-needed victory for the Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbour.
            the bombers took off from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet on April 18th, 1942.
            Only 1 of the bombers managed to land intact while the rest crashed in the ocean.
            out of the 80 aircrews, 69 of them survived and managed to make it back to America one way or another.
            The B-25 was capable of carrying a payload of 2400 lb (1,100 kg) of bombs over 1,200 mi (1,900 km).

            I fell in love with the design of the B-25 almost instantly and it has a very fascinating story which I wished more people would know.
            The story of army bombers lifting off an aircraft carrier and managing to be the first in the world to bomb mainland Japan is just so great.
            It feels like fiction and that is what makes me interested in historic wars and what happened.

            <div class="brodtext">


        <p>
            The P-47 Was a fighter aircraft that served in the American airforce during the second world war.
            The P-47 saw battle on the European theater and was regarded as “the jug” due to its profile being similar to that of a common milk jug of the time.
            The P-47 Primary armament consists of eight 50.caliber(12.7mm) machine guns.
            It could also carry five-inch rockets or a bomb load of 2,500 pounds (1,133 kg).
            The P-47 was a tough aircraft and could take many hits and still keep going.
            Many Luftwaffe pilots were advised by aces to approach the P-47 carefully.
            The P-47 was eventually replaced by the P-51 in a long-range bomber escort role but later replaced the roles switched as the P-47 had bigger fuel tanks and could go further into the heart of Germany.
            The P-47 escorted several bomber squadrons on their way to Germany and on their way back the pilots shot up any ground targets they could find.
            They even used bombs if they had any on them, which led to the realization that the P-47 could perform ground attacks and close air support for ground forces.

            I have always been fascinated by the P-47 because of its shape and bulk.
            There is just something about a flying barrel that brings a smile to me every time I think about it.
            The reason why I wanted to find out more about this aircraft and its origin is because of the A-10 Thunderbolt 2.
            I loved the A-10 because of its massive armament of weapons and bombs.
            I love seeing the underside of wings being covered in machine guns, missiles, and bombs so when I realized that there must be a thunderbolt 1 I googled it up and was amazed by the rich history of the P-47.
            it was a well-made fighter that could serve multiple purposes and could take a punch and still continue to fight.

            <div class="brodtext">


        <p>
            The SBD was a scout fighter/dive bomber that served in the American navy during the second world war.
            It is most known for bombing Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway in June 1942.
            Many SBDs were stationed on Pearl harbor and a majority of them were destroyed during the Japanese attack.
            Several SBDs were flying to Pearl Harbour from their naval carrier strike group and were engaged by swarms of Japanese zeros.
            None of them survived the attack.
            The SBD's most important contribution to the American war effort came during the Battle of Midway in early June 1942.
            Four squadrons of Navy SBD dive bombers attacked and sank or fatally damaged all four Japanese fleet carriers present, disabling three of them in the span of just six minutes.
            They also caught two straggling heavy cruisers of the Midway bombardment group of four, heavily damaging them, with Mikuma eventually sinking.
            A few SBD squadrons were stationed on the midway islands and their pilots weren’t trained well enough on dive-bombing so they resorted to the slower but easier glide bombing technique.
            This led to many of the SBDs being shot down when they became vulnerable during their glide.

                    The SBD was a crucial aircraft for the Americans during the second world war.
                    It served as the backbone of the American firepower and was the only fighter capable of dealing     that much damage at seas.
                    Again I am fascinated by the rich history of the SBD Dauntless and its pilots.
                    What they did during the pacific war and especially during the battle of midway was insane.
                    They were against the odds and managed to destroy all of the Japanese aircraft carriers.
                    It sounds like fiction yet it happened.
                    The pilots were the underdog yet they came out victorious which just amazes me every time.
